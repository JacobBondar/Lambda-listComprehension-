# Lambda-listComprehension-

The program provides two distinct exercises for the user to choose from.

In the first exercise, the program prompts the user to input a series of numbers
 until an empty input is given. It then calculates and displays
 the sum, minimum, maximum, and average of the input values.
The results are clearly printed, and the function that performs these
 calculations is documented with a help() call.

The second exercise allows the user to enter sentences repeatedly.
For each sentence, the program uses both list comprehensions and
 lambda with map/filter techniques to perform several tasks:
 - Count and display the length of each word (if alphabetic).
 - Count each letterâ€™s occurrences in the sentence.
 - Generate tuples for each word showing the number of vowels and consonants.
 - List all words with 4 or more letters.

After processing the sentence with both approaches, the program compares their
 results and displays whether they matched (they will always match).
It also prints a side-by-side view
  of all the results from both methods for easy comparison.

The user can repeatedly choose between "ex1" and "ex2", or press Enter to exit
 the program.
